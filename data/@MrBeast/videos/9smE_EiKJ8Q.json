Then there's the tests. If learning shit you don't care about and losing your time wasn't enough, you have to be good at it as well. Or else, you get bad grades and you're getting yelled at by everybody and feel like shit  while your family gets torn apart with rage. But wait, there's more! Not only do you not learn anything that interests you because it isn't a science, but you have to PAY for it as well sometimes. And the worst part is, everybody seems to be okay with this crap, no one tries to speak up and change things. Is this really what school should be in the eyes of the government?...",

We don't need to learn science, history, art, music, but we have to graduate, in jail they teach you how to do good in the outside world. I wake up at 6:30AM and i eat lunch at 1:08 PM and if you don't have a ID you DON'T EAT LIKE WHAT THE FUCK also dropping the soap, in school. You always have that one kid you want to fuck up for some stupid reason. Teachers don't solve bullying, they make it WORSE. Kids bully because they are having bad times in the real world. From scientists. WELL SCHOOL GIVES THEM A REASON TO BE STRESSED, just school makes no Sense to me honestly.",

The issue is that we have been brainwashed that learning takes place within 4 walls called school but learning occurs all the time and everywhere.  It's not an A or a B scribbled on a piece of paper.  My kids have learned tons playing video games and they also live in Europe and have been immersed in several different cultures so they have a great understanding of how others live and don't subscribe to the we do it the best mantra because we are Americans.\n\nSchool is a place to put kids so their parents can work.  BTW, I just watched a program where a young lady in her 20's had no idea who Napoleon was and asked who he was.  She went to school.  We assume that because we bring up some material that whoever deems important, it will be retained by the student.  Napoleon is an important individual in our history but the bottom line knowing who he is has no practical use in most people's lives.  Just don't go to any cocktail parties in the near future.  HA!",

We learned the basics and in high school we just take tests and pointless things especially in English I know how to make proper paragraph people understand what I'm writing so I don't get it. The other subjects are easy for me personally I mean I've learned about WWII since I was in 4th by myself and I understand physics and algebra but I don't understand why we need to know half these things and if I did we have internet now, we could look up videos and you could just go to the library and use a computer or get a book for something you actually need! That's all I got but I'm not saying we shouldn't have school at all we should have it up to 8th grade to get the basics in.",

This world is honestly sad, you are categorized as smart if you know how to  count how many squares there are like that makes me sick. The most successful people on this damn planet are rich and successful and there shit has nothing to do with school. Actors, Singer, Sports players. Like honestly fuck school",

Here's a few thing I learned in school that I'll never be needing:\n\n-Socializing with other people\n-Teamwork\n-How to analyze a text to understand a message\n-Ow to rite proparlly\n-How to give a good argumentation\n-How to speak in public and be at ease doing so\n-Basic first aid\n-A second and a third language\n-How the Canadian government works (especially useless since we had an election recently)\n-Some geopolitics and geography\n-Calculus (I'm majoring in economics and I was sure Id' never use it. And I'm totally right)\n-Religions of the world (especially useless since NOTHING happens in the news regarding religion)\n-How to write a resume\n-How my body works (and that's why I'm an anti-vaxxer)\n-Sex Ed. (but I planned on staying a virgin my entire life... such a waste of my time :( )\n-The Canadian Food Guide\n-Woodworking\n-Understanding statistics\n-Reasearch skill\n-Using the Office Suite efficiently\n\n\n\nAnd I'm sure I'm forgetting somethings.
