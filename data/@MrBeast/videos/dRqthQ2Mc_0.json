What's disturbing about it is that it only shows changelogs for youtube vids this year.

Any who,  in the nine months they've been recording their actions taken against, they've added more than 4.4 million videos to the count. That is an alarming number of videos!",

If u didn't have the rights of either a music, image or something and your making money off of it, thats not ok. BUT!!! WHAT PISSES ME OFF IS THAT ITS NEVER CLEAR WHAT IS LEGAL TO DO OR NOT, I MEAN, I KNOW SOME OF MY FRIENDS ARE YOUTUBERS, AND THEY GOT THERE VIDEO KILLED OFF BY SPAM404 BECAUSE HE DIDNT HAVE THE RIGHTS TO A MUSIC OR SOME CRAP... THAT VIDEO WAS 30 MINUTES LONG, AND IT TOOK HIM MORE THAN 3 DAYS OF NON-STOP WORK TO FINISH IT. HE HAD THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION AND HE SPECIFIED THAT HE DIDNT OWN THE RIGHTS OF THE MUSIC, AND GAVE HIS EMAIL ADRESS SO PEOPLE COULD CONTACT HIM IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM. SPAM NEVER CONTACTED HIM ON HIS EMAIL(Which is what he uses the most, he never goes on twitter). When he saw his video taken down, he didn't understand. He contacted Spam404, and he told me that they basically  ignored him. They told him that they would contact him later. They never called",
